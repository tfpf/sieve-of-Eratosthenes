# Sieve of Atkin

A prime sieving algorithm which is faster than a wheel-factorised sieve of Eratosthenes. I have implemented the
optimised technique described by Atkin and Bernstein. While Bernstein has already provided an optimised implementation,
I found the code very hard to understand, so I wrote it from scratch myself.

Also included here is an non-optimal implementation of the sieve of Eratosthenes which I wrote a long time ago.
